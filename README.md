The code had to meet these conditions:

Built-in sorting algorithms are not allowed, developers have to implement sorting themselves if needed.

Unless stated otherwise, any algorithm/data structure can be used to solve the exercise, as long as it is implemented by the developer.

You must implement and use Graph with (doubly-linked) adjacency lists and (doubly-linked) vertex and edge lists.

You must implement and use Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithm, as a method of the Graph class called FirstnameLastname_sp or FirstnameLastname_sp (replacing FirstnameLastname with your name)

Implemented Graph data structure must be generic over the type of vertex and edge labels. But you may assume and cast to a specific type the weights on edges in the MST method.
